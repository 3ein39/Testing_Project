# QA & Testing Project 2025

## Project Description

This project involves creating an automation testing suite for a chosen website using Selenium, TestNG, and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.

## Project Requirements

* **Technology:** Automation testing using Selenium, TestNG, and Page Object Model (POM).
* **Website:** Choose a website of your preference.
* **Team Size:** Individual or team (up to 6 members).
* **Number of Scripts:** The minimum number of required automation scripts must not be less than the number of team members.
    * *Example:* If a team has 6 members, the minimum number of required scripts is 6.
* **Website Duplication:** Each chosen website can only be duplicated once across all projects.
* **Registration:** Every team must register their members and the chosen website in the provided Excel sheet.
* **Registration Deadline:** The deadline for submitting your team details and website in the Excel sheet is **25/4**.

## What Constitutes a Valid Script?

An automation script describes a test scenario based on the scope of the chosen website.

* **Examples of valid script scenarios:**
    * Sign up and Login
    * Purchase a product
    * Compare between products
* A script does **not** simply mean testing a web page individually. Automation testing is useful for interacting between different modules and pages to complete a scenario.
